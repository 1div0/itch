# itch.io app

**This project is in very early development!**

The goal of this project is to give you a desktop application that you can
download and run games from [itch.io](http://itch.io) with. Additionally you
should be able to update games and get notified when games are updated. The
goal is not to replace the itch.io website.

## Installing

The itch.io app is built in HTML/SCSS/ES6 and runs inside of Electron.
Install the following to get started with development:

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* Install [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron), and [gulp](http://gittup.org/tup/):

```
npm install -g electron-prebuilt gulp
```

Check out this repository

Run the following commands:

```bash
$ npm install
$ (cd app && npm install)
$ gulp
```

You can now run the app:

```bash
$ (cd app && electron .)
```
