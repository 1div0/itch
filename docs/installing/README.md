# Installing itch

We've worked very hard on making the app as easy to install and keep up-to-date
as possible.

The canonical download page for the app is <https://itch.io/app> â€” however,
it is pretty minimal. The download button leads to a page that will attempt to
detect your current platform and redirect you to the appropriate download.

Our [Github releases]() page contains a list of all available
downloads, including version notes for all releases ever. Feel free to use this page
if the automatic platform detection doesn't work for you.

**Additionally, there are .deb and .rpm repositories, and AUR packages** that
you might miss out on if you rely on the main download page. To learn more about these,
simply refer to the appropriate subsection of this book:

  * [Installing on Windows](windows.md)
  * [Installing on Mac OSX](osx.md)
  * [Installing on Linux](linux/README.md)
