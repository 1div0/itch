Old app (<= 0.13.x) needed you to add to a collection.

New app has search

If fails to download:

  * Maybe it's missing tags (reach out to dev or admin, either can fix it)
  * Maybe you need to buy it (min-price uploads have poor UX in the app right now)

Downloads pause when you quit the app & resume when you boot it back up again.

Old app kept too many downloads around, here's how you can check â€” new one hopefully
has cleanup routine built-in

Mention directories.
