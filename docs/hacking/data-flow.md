Electron apps are a bit peculiar, because they have two types of processes:

  * A single node.js process, that lives throughout the application's runtime
  * Renderer processes, one per browser window (or web contents, really)

Thanks to Electron's `node-integration`, both of these can `require()` the same
modules â€” but they're different copies, being executed by different JavaScript
runtimes, completely isolated, so if you have a module like this:

```JavaScript
module.exports = { prop: 'initial' }
```

And then do this in the renderer process:

```JavaScript
require('./my-module').prop = 'renderer!'
```

Then the following will still be true in the browser process:

```JavaScript
require('')
```
